    <p class="pFont">I love cars. I have always been eager to work on them, and recently I finally was able to do what I have always wanted by changing the brakes, the brake lights, and very soon the spark plugs of a car.   </p>

    <p class="pFont">Throughout my life I have been known to be relatively tech-savvy. I live up to that title by enjoying to code and generally making stuff on my computer. I began to fully realize love for coding in 9th grade in my Intro to Website Design course where I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is really fun to be able to create whatever I want and look smart doing it. (ish)</p>

    <p class="pFont">Ever since I was a child, I have been playing basketball. I have almost always been part of a team and playing in a league, and I enjoy doing so. While I may not be the best on my team, I always try my hardest and play well. I also like the Lakers, as I was born in LA and "watched" a Lakers game on TV while I was in the hospital after my birth.</p>
